    <p>For Freegle groups only.</p>
    <p>Replies between users flow through the system, and we try to find ones which might be spam or scam.</p>
    <p>This page shows the replies which you need to review.  Until you do, they won't be visible to the recipient (i.e. the user it was sent to).</p>
    <p>You can:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Click <em>Not Spam</em> to approve the reply, then it will become visible to the recipient.</li>
        <li>Click <em>Spam</em> to delete the reply, then it will not be visible to the recipient.  The sender will still see it, so that
            they don't try different ways to get through.  If you delete a reply, it won't affect the original message.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        In time there will be more function in here to do more things, e.g. add a note or ban members.  But for now
        this lets you protect your members from seeing messages they shouldn't.

    <p>This won't affect what members see until we switch over to FDv3.</p>
