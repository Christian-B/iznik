        These are recent messages which we think might be spam.  They can either be Pending messages which haven't reached your
        group, or Approved messages which are already on the group.
    </p>
    <p>We err on the safe side, so sometimes you'll see messages which aren't spam here, for you to check.</p>
    <p>
        This is about the specific message, not the sender.  If you think this message is spam, click the <em>Spam</em> button and we'll deal with them.  If they're not
        spam, click the <em>Not Spam</em> button and they'll be returned to <em>Pending</em> or
        <em>Approved</em> as appropriate.   If you think the sender is a deliberate spammer, use the <em>Spammer</em> button to report them as well.
