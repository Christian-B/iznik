                <p>Please remember that people may not be spammers just because they've sent a spam message.  For example:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Members may join many groups because they are over-enthusiastic or have relatives in different places.</li>
                    <li>Mail can be spoofed or accounts can be hacked - so a member can appear to send spam but not be a spammer.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>For someone to be added to the spammer list they need to have clear intent to deliberately spam/scam, or be a massive multijoiner.  Otherwise you should just mark the message as spam.</p>
                <p>This reason will be visible to other moderators, so please make sure it's helpful.</p>
