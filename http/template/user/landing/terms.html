<h1 class="text-center largest">Terms of Use</h1>
<p>We could give you a ten page long Terms of Use.  Like you'd read that.</p>
<p>As far as we're concerned, it's simple:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Use Freegle to pass on unwanted items direct to others.</li>
    <li>Everything must be free and legal.</li>
    <li>Be nice to other Freeglers, and they'll be nice to you.</li>
    <li>We don't see or check items offered - see our <a href="/disclaimer">disclaimer</a>.</li>
    <li>Freegle groups may have additional rules - check your local group for details.</li>
    <li>Please keep yourself safe and watch out for scams.</li>
    <li>Objectionable content or behaviour will not be tolerated.</li>
    <li>If you see anything inappropriate, suspicious or just dodgy then please <a href="/help">report it</a>.</li>
    <li>You must be aged 12 or over, as there is user-generated content.</li>
    <li>We wonâ€™t sell your email address to anyone else - see <a href="/privacy">privacy page</a>.</li>
    <li>For some Freegle local groups, you are likely to be obliged to adhere to <a href="https://policies.yahoo.com/ie/en/yahoo/terms/utos/index.htm" target="_blank" data-realurl="true">Yahoo!
