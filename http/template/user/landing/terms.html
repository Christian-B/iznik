<h1 class="text-center largest">Terms of Use</h1>
<p>We could give you a ten page long Terms of Use.  Like you'd read that.</p>
<p>As far as we're concerned, it's simple:</p>
<ol>
    <li>be nice to other freeglers, and they'll be nice to you</li>
    <li>don't try to buy, sell or borrow - that's not what we do</li>
    <li>did we mention being nice?</li>
</ol>
<p>
    Behind the scenes, some Freegle groups use Yahoo! Groups, so you may be obliged to adhere to
    Yahooâ€™s Terms of Use. You can read their ten page long terms
