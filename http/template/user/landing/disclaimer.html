<h2>Safety</h2>
<p>
    Freeglers are lovely.  But many of them will be people you've never met before.  So please use common sense when
    posting to Freegle or collecting an item.  For example:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Don't post in public on Freegle telling people when you're going to be out.</li>
    <li>Most collections occur at home, but if you're worried about that, arrange to meet in a cafe or other public place.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Scams</h2>
<p>
    Regrettably, occasionally online scammers target Freegle groups, often by offering high-value items, and then
    asking you to pay for courier charges.  We catch a lot of these, and you never see them, but occasionally some sneak through.
</p>
<p>
    While some groups allow postage, you should never hand over money in advance.  We don't recommend any
    specific courier (so if you see a message saying we do, itâ€™s a scam).
</p>
<p>If you are unlucky enough to be scammed, please report it to the
